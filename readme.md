Guard is an IoT security system that detects abnormalities in smart-home IoT devices and allows smart-home owners to monitor their smart homes via mobile application. <br />

## Aim:<br />

Detect abnormalities in IoT devices and inform smart-home owner of these abnormalities through a mobile application.<br />

## Technologies used: <br />

#### Hardware:<br />
Raspberry Pi<br />
Breakout Garden<br />
BME688 sensor (Air Quality)<br />
LTR559 sensor (Light Sensor)<br />
AS7262 sensor (Spectrum)<br />
LSM303D sensor (Motion)<br />

#### Software:<br />
Python<br />
Visual Code Studio<br />
